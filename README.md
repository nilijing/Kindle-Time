# Kindle-Time Refresh automatically every day!

My kindle is now ash covered after it was a instant noodle cover. I was wondering that can this ink screen be made into an electronic calendar which is modern and does not consume much electricity? 

Of course it is 100% possible! 

### Materials that we need:
Kindle that is connected to Wifi 



### Steps:
1.Open TextEdit to write our 'time.html' webpage.

2.Kindle will automatically sleep and lock the screen when there is no operation for a long time. In order to keep the calendar or clock displayed all the time, we shall need to use the automatic lock screen function.
enter the ~ds command in the search box.

3.Open the Kindle browser and enter the URL of our 'time.html'.

4.Set up the Kindle, and then you can use the Kindle as an electronic clock!
